## Vender Recipes

Here you'll find recipes you can use when selling items to vendors. This is not a complete list.

### ðŸ“œ +1 to level of gems recipe

This is very useful recipe to boost level of your skill gems while leveling. This recipe adds +1 to level of fire/lightning/cold gems mod to an item.

* Magic wand/sceptre
* Ruby Ring (fire gems)/Topaz Ring (lightning gems)/Sapphire Ring (cold gems)
* Orb of Alteration

### ðŸ“œ 20% quality skill gem

* 1x level 20 skill gem
* 1x gem cutterâ€™s prism

Will return a level 1 gem with 20% quality.

### ðŸ“œ 40% quality

You need armor, weapons, maps or flasks with total quality of 40% or more for this recipe to work. For example, if I want 1 armorerâ€™s scrap, I will sell chest armor with 16% quality + boots with 15% quality + helm with 12% quality. The same applies for flasks, weapons, maps and skill gems.

```text
* Weapons > Blacksmithâ€™s Whetstone
* Armor > Armourerâ€™s Scrap
* Maps > Cartographerâ€™s Chisel
* Flask > Glassblowerâ€™s Bauble
* Skill Gem > Gemcutterâ€™s Prism
```

> Do not use gems with quality greater than 10% for this recipe, better sell them to other players for greater profit.

### ðŸ“œ Block chance reduction gem

* 1x dexterity-based shield with 20% quality
* Puncture gem

### ðŸ“œ Cartographerâ€™s Chisel

* 1x Stone hammer/Rock breaker/Gavel with 20% quality
* 1x any map

> Use lower tier maps.

### ðŸ“œ Chaos Orb

Trading 1 full set of level 60+ rare equipmen:

* 1x orb for identified items
* 2x orbs if all items are 20% quality
* 3x orbs if all items are 20% quality and unidentified

> **Set**: Weapon and shield or 2H, chest, gloves, belt, boots, amulet, and rings.

### ðŸ“œ Chromatic Orb

* 1x weapon or armor with red, green and blue sockets that are linked together

### ðŸ“œ Jewelerâ€™s Orb

* 1x item with 6 sockets

### ðŸ“œ Map upgrade

Selling 3x maps of same level will give you map one level higher. For example, selling 3 Tier 1 maps to a vendor will give you 1 Tier 2 map. All the maps have to be the same.

### ðŸ“œ Physical damage / Spell damage

**Physical damage**:

* 1x weapon
* 1x Blacksmithâ€™s Whetstone
* 1x Rustic Sash

Increased physical damage depends on Rustic Sash rarity and item level. Magic (blue) gives 40-49% and Rare (yellow) gives 50-69% increase.

**Spell damage**:

* 1x dagger/sceptre/wand/staff
* 1x Blacksmithâ€™s Whetstone
* 1x Chain Belt

Increased spell damage depends on Chain Belt rarity and item level. Magic (blue) gives 10-19% and Rare (yellow) gives 20-29% increase.

### ðŸ“œ Skill gem level reduction

Downgrade skill gem by 1 level.

* 1x skill gem
* 1x Orb of Scouring

### ðŸ“œ Skill gem level reset

Resets gem back to level 1.

* 1x skill gem
* 1x Orb of Regret

### ðŸ“œ Vaal Orb

* 7 Vaal Skill gems
* 1 Sacrifice at Dawn/Dusk/Noon will give you 1 Vaal orb.

> Do not use Sacrifice of Midnight for this recipe, that would be terrible waste of currency.
