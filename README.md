## Vender Recipes

Here you'll find recipes you can use when selling items to vendors. This is not a complete list, just useful list of players. 

---

### ðŸ“œ +1 to level of gems recipe

This is very useful recipe to boost level of your skill gems while leveling. This recipe adds +1 to level of fire/lightning/cold gems mod to an item. 

* Magic wand/sceptre
* Ruby Ring (fire gems)/Topaz Ring (lightning gems)/Sapphire Ring (cold gems)
* Orb of Alteration

---

### ðŸ“œ 20% quality skill gem

* 1x level 20 skill gem
* 1x gem cutterâ€™s prism

Will return a level 1 gem with 20% quality.

---

### ðŸ“œ 40% quality

It works as follows â€“ you need armor, weapons, maps or flasks with total quality of 40% or more for this recipe to work. For example, if I want 1 armorerâ€™s scrap, I will sell chest armor with 16% quality + boots with 15% quality + helm with 12% quality. The same applies for flasks, weapons, maps and skill gems. One tip â€“ do not use gems with quality greater than 10% for this recipe, better sell them to other players for greater profit.

### ðŸ“œ Block chance reduction gem

If you like PvP, this PoE vendor recipe allows you to obtain Block chance reduction gem. 

* 1x dexterity-based shield with 20% quality
* Puncture gem

---

### ðŸ“œ Cartographerâ€™s Chisel
 
 * 1x Stone hammer/Rock breaker/Gavel with 20% quality 
 * 1x any map
 
 > Use lower tier maps.

---

### ðŸ“œ Chaos Orb

Trading 1 full set of level 60+ rare equipment will grant 1 or 2 Chaos Orb's. 1 for identified, 2 for unidenfied.

> Weapon + shield or 2H, pair of rings, amulet, chest, gloves, belt, and boots.

### ðŸ“œ Chromatic Orb

* 1x weapon or armor with red, green and blue sockets that are linked together

---

### ðŸ“œ Jewelerâ€™s Orb

* 1x item with 6 sockets

---

### ðŸ“œ Map upgrade

Selling 3x maps of same level will give you map one level higher. For example, selling 3 Tier 1 maps to a vendor will give you 1 Tier 2 map. All the maps have to be the same.

---

### ðŸ“œ Physical damage / Spell damage

**Physical damage**:

* 1x weapon
* 1x Blacksmithâ€™s Whetstone
* 1x Rustic Sash

Increased physical damage depends on Rustic Sash rarity and item level. Magic (Blue) gives 40-49% and Rare (Yellow) gives 50-69% increase.

**Spell damage**:

* 1x dagger/sceptre/wand/staff
* 1x Blacksmithâ€™s Whetstone
* 1x Chain Belt

Increased spell damage depends on Chain Belt rarity and item level. Magic (Blue) gives 10-19% and Rare (Yellow) gives 20-29% increase.

### ðŸ“œ Skill gem level reduction

Downgrade skill gem by 1 level.

### ðŸ“œ Skill gem level reset
